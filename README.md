# Facebook (clone)

Facebook is a leading social media platform across the globe. It has an ability to connect and share with the people you care about.

In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of Facebook. With our 
efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned 
so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality.
